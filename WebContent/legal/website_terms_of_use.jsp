		<p>These Terms are intended to be for the benefit of each of AGS, its Related Bodies Corporate and their respective Personnel.</p>

		<h2>The Compare the Market Website</h2>
		<p>The Compare the Market Website and the Comparison Websites provide an information service to compare certain products and services on the basis of particular criteria you may select including brand and price. The products and services compared are not representative of all the products and services available in the market. The Comparison Websites, which are available via hyperlink from the Compare the Market Website, are owned, operated and controlled by a third party and not AGS. AGS takes no responsibility for the Comparison Websites or their content, and separate terms and conditions available on the Comparison Websites apply to those Comparison Websites. For further information, refer to "Third Party Sites and Advertising" below.</p>
		<p>The Compare the Market Website provides you with factual information, advertisements and links to other websites. It may also contain general recommendations about products and services and what to consider when buying. However, it contains no personal recommendations, suggestions or advice about the suitability of a product or service for you and your needs, and does not take into account your individual circumstances. Furthermore, AGS is not a provider of credit services, makes no suggestions about particular credit products or providers, does not assist you to apply for particular credit products and does not act as intermediary for the purposes of arranging credit for you with a credit provider.  Before acting on the information and guidance provided by the Compare the Market Website , you should evaluate your own individual needs, objectives and situation and which products are suitable for you, and if necessary seek independent financial or investment advice before making a decision to acquire.</p>
		<p>For insurance products, always read the Product Disclosure Statement from the relevant Supplier before making any decision to acquire or hold insurance. For all other products and services, read the relevant terms and conditions supplied by the Supplier before deciding to acquire the product or service.</p>
		<p>In respect of insurance products, the Australia Post, Budget Direct, ibuyeco, Virgin Money, Cashback, 1st for Women, Retirease and Ozicare insurance products ("Auto &amp; General Brands") compared on this site are insurance policies arranged by AGS for and on behalf of Auto &amp; General, which is a related company and issuer of those products. If you purchase an Auto &amp; General Brand, AGS will earn a commission and referral fee as detailed in the FSG available on the Compare the Market Website. In respect of other insurance products compared on this site, AGS will receive a referral fee if you buy a product, as detailed in the FSG. AGS's commission and referral fees do not increase the amount of premium quoted on the Compare the Market Website.</p>
		<p>In respect of the other products and services compared on the Comparison Websites, AGS will earn a referral fee for each product and service sold or customer successfully referred as a result of a comparison or for each application for credit accepted by the credit provider. The referral fee does not increase the amount quoted for the product or service.</p>
		<p>If you decide to make inquiries about or acquire a particular product or service, you will deal directly with the provider of the relevant product or service.  AGS does not guarantee that any product or service can be provided to you as the Supplier's eligibility criteria and terms and conditions will apply. If you decide to purchase a particular product or service (other than a home loan) using:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>a link you will be taken to the Supplier's website to make your application and/or payment;</li>
		    <li>the telephone contact details to make your application and/or payment, you will do so via the Supplier's call centre.</li> 
		</ul>

		<p>For home loans, if you decide to apply for a home loan, by using a link on the Comparison Websites, you will be directed to the Supplier's website to make your application.
