		<h1>Compare the Market Privacy Policy</h1>
		
		<p>Your personal information is very important to Auto &amp; General Services Pty Ltd (<b>AGS</b>) ACN 003 617 909, (the company that owns the Compare the Market brand, trading name and website). This privacy policy will provide you with details of the type of information AGS may collect from you on the Compare the Market website, the purposes for which the information is used, how the information is managed and to whom it may be disclosed.  Your personal information includes information that can be used to identify you, for example - your name, address, telephone number and age.</p>
		
		<h2>Overview of the Privacy Laws</h2>
		
		<p>The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) sets out certain National Privacy Principles which govern the way in which AGS can collect, use, keep, secure and disclose your personal information.  The aim of the privacy laws is to ensure that organisations manage and handle personal information responsibly and give  individuals the right to know what personal information an organisation holds about them and a right to correct that information if it is wrong. </p>
		
		<h2>Collection of Information</h2>
		
		<p>AGS may collect personal information from you in order to provide you with a comparison service or to allow an insurance provider to contact you with your consent.  </p>
		
		<p>Any personal information that you provide for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a car insurance comparison is collected by AGS.  </li>
		
			<li>a mobile phone, broadband, credit card, home loan and pay TV comparison is collected by WhistleOut Pty Ltd (<b>WhistleOut</b>). Such information is collected and managed by WhistleOut in accordance with their <a href="http://www.whistleout.com.au/Privacy" target="_new">privacy policy</a>. WhistleOut does not transfer the personal information it collects from you to AGS.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>AGS collects feedback from website users about the Compare the Market website, the Compare the Market car insurance comparison service and the comparison services offered by WhistleOut. This feedback is provided anonymously - we will not ask you for your personal details. </p>
		
		<h2>Use and Disclosure of Information</h2>
		
		<p>AGS uses the personal information we collect from the Compare the Market car insurance comparison to provide you with car insurance quotes. We also give that information to each participating insurer and insurance provider so they may provide a car insurance quote. (An insurance provider is a person who acts as an agent for a participating insurer.)  </p>
		
		<p>AGS allows you to submit your contact details (e.g. telephone number, email address) if you want to be contacted by the insurer or insurance provider who gives you the lowest quote on our car insurance comparison. We will only give your contact details to that insurer or insurance provider if you elect to be contacted by them (i.e. you say 'Yes' to these options on the car insurance comparison pages). </p>
		
		<p>AGS may use your e-mail address to send you a summary of your car insurance comparison results.   </p>
		
		<p>AGS may also request your e-mail address for the inclusion into a mailing list, which will allow AGS and our affiliated companies to provide you with updates or information about their products and services. If you choose to submit your e-mail address for inclusion into a mailing list, an option to remove this address from AGS's database will be offered to you via e-mail correspondence. All opt-in e-mails sent to the mailing list will comply with the Australian Spam Act. </p>
		
		<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
		<p>From time to time, AGS may use data collection devices such as 'cookies' in conjunction with the Compare the Market website. </p>
		
		<p>AGS may use the services of a marketing company in evaluating any 'cookies' information to measure the effectiveness of its advertising and how visitors use the Compare the Market website in order to: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide you with better and more customised service and a more effective website; </li>
		
			<li>Collect anonymous statistical information on things such as how many visitors the Compare the Market Website receives, how those visitors use the site and where they came from. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Any information that is used in this way will be in an aggregated and 'anonymised' form. AGS does not use it to identify you as an individual. If you wish, you can configure your browser so it does not accept cookies, but this may affect the functionality of the Compare the Market website. </p>
		
		<h2>Access to Personal Information</h2>
		
		<p>You can request access to the personal information AGS holds about you at any time and we will provide you with the requested information unless there are exceptional circumstances under law, which prevent us from providing you with the information. AGS may charge a fee for access to this information, but you will be advised of any applicable fee prior to AGS proceeding with your request. </p>
		
		<h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
		
		<p>AGS will take reasonable measures to ensure that the personal information it holds about you is accurate and up to date. If you believe your personal information is not accurate and up to date, please inform AGS and we will undertake to promptly update this information. </p>
		
		<h2>Information Security</h2>
		
		<p>AGS will take reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information that it holds about you is protected against any unlawful use or access and is kept safe and secure. There is always a risk in sending and receiving information over the internet, but once your personal information is received, AGS will take reasonable steps to protect and secure that information. </p>
		
		<p>To maximise the protection of your personal information, always close your browser and log out once you have finished using the internet to prevent other people gaining access to your information and correspondence. </p>
		
		<h2>Further Questions and Privacy Concerns</h2>
		<p>If you have any questions or concerns about how AGS handles your personal information or would like to access it or update it, please write to AGS's Compliance Manager at PO Box 342, Toowong QLD 4066 or contact us on privacyquery@AGServices.com.au. </p>
		
		<p>If your privacy concerns are not resolved satisfactorily or you wish to obtain more information on the privacy legislation, you can contact the Federal Privacy Commissioner on 1300 363 992, or visit their website at <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au" target="_new">www.privacy.gov.au</a>. </p>
