		<li>Frank will be in touch with you within the next 2 business days.</li> 
		<li>Depending on your circumstances you will be emailed an Australian Government Rebate form, a copy of the direct debit service agreement, a switch form and a form to give someone else permission to enquire on your behalf. Please print them, sign them and get them back to Frank as soon as you can. Your premium cannot reflect the rebate until the signed form has been received.</li>
		<li>Frank will post out your membership cards 24-48 hours after your policy is activated.</li>
		<li>Please note that your first payment may reflect the non-rebated amount but will be adjusted once the AGR form has been received. There may also be a pro-rated amount included in the initial premium to cover the time between the start date and the payment deduction date.</li>
		<li>You can start claiming (provided there are no waiting periods) once your first payment has been made.</li>
