No one will ever be able to give you a guarantee
that you'll never get sick or have an accident, but regardless of what life brings it's
important to know that you can access the health services you need whenever you need them.
That's why all CUA Health policies have no exclusions for medical treatment. So whatever happens you can relax
knowing you are covered.  Choose from 65% to 100% hospital cover and add Gold or Silver Extras to suit. CUA Health
is comprehensive cover for every possibility.
