		<li>Your application will be sent to HCF for processing</li>
		<li>HCF will send you an email shortly with your membership number and details of your next steps</li> 
		<li>Please ensure that you action any paperwork promptly and return back to HCF</li>
		<li>If you have chosen a start date which is before your first payment date, please note that your first payment will be the regular premium plus an amount to cover the time between the start date and the payment deduction date</li> 
		<li>If you have selected a date for regular payment that is close to today's date, your first payment may not be deducted until the following month (as it generally takes 5 days for your direct debit to be set up).  This will mean that a double payment will be deducted at that time</li>
		<li>You will be covered from midnight of the date you have selected to join and can start claiming (provided there are no waiting periods) from the time you make your first payment</li>
