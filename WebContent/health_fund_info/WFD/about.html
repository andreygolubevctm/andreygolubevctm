Westfund offers cover right across Australia. They're stable, secure and have been looking after members for a long time. Westfund's heritage goes back to 1929
where they began as a co-operative, taking contributions to pay for doctors and ambulance officers for mining sites. That heritage as a not-for-profit,
member-owned fund has remained at the heart of the Westfund identity. Westfund maintains a full range of health cover options including hospital,
general treatment (extras) and combined covers. Their Access Gap Cover for medical specialists can minimise the cost of hospital treatment and
their family covers include several options to maintain dependants up to 25 years of age.
