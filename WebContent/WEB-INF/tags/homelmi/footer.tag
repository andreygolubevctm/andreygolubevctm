	<p>When you're shopping for home and contents insurance, price isn't the only thing you'd want to consider - it's also important to take into account the features and benefits of each policy. After all, each product's cover can vary, so it pays to compare.</p>
	<p>To help you better understand the different options out there, take a look at the data displayed which compares the features and benefits of a wide range of home and contents insurance products. This data was supplied by an independent third party insurance research company, LMI Group Ptd Ltd (LMI), and is maintained by them.
