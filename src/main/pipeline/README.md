# Web CTM Gulp

Developed by a previous CTMer, this Gulp pipeline compiles multiple assets and outputs them to the target directory of the build.

To run a full build, run `gulp`
To run a build of a particular package, do `gulp bundle:health` where `health` can be any bundle name based on the folder structure.
