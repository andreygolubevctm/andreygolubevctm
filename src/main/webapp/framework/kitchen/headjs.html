			<!-- The reason it's recommended placing Modernizr in the head is two-fold: the HTML5 Shiv (that enables HTML5 elements in IE) must execute before the <body>, and if you’re using any of the CSS classes that Modernizr adds, you’ll want to prevent a FOUC. -->

			<!-- This really shouldn't be here, but in the interests of preserving code brought in by markers that just expects things to "be there", we do this. respond.js was thrown into this block because it is also under the same lt ie9 test -->
