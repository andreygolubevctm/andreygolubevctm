<div class="about-the-fund">
	<p>Queensland Country Health Fund was established in 1977 as the MIM Employees Health Society. The Fund became an open health fund in 1999 enabling us to offer cover to a wider market, with a particular focus on regional and remote areas of Queensland.</p>
	<p>We believe paying good benefits for health services is only part of providing great value. Our main focus is our Members and their family's health. We're committed to providing the best possible products and services within a simple and easy to understand product suite.</p>
	<p>We offer some unique benefits for our Members, like the provision of unit accommodation in Townsville and Brisbane when required for essential medical reasons. This accommodation is offered exclusively to our Members at concessional rates. </p>
	<p>We also have recently opened Queensland Country Dental at our new head office in Townsville. This provides our Members with access to high quality dental care with little or no out of pocket expenses (depending on level of Extras cover). The aim is to improve the oral health of our Members by making dental treatment more accessible and affordable.</p>
	<p>This year Canstar awarded us with the state award for outstanding value on private hospital cover, a five star rating for the best value range of hospital products available in Queensland. This is a testament to the value for money proposition that our product suite offers. We back this with exceptional customer service- our Member's always come first.</p>
