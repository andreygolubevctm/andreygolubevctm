<p>I wish to apply for the health insurance product I have chosen and become a member of Westfund. I have read the policy document and the terms and conditions document and have specifically noted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>waiting periods</li>
	<li>the pre-existing ailment and condition rule</li>
	<li>exclusions and restrictions</li>
	<li>excesses and co-payments</li>
	<li>benefit limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand how these apply to my circumstances and to the circumstances of all persons included in the application for health insurance. Where I have not understood any of the information in the <a href="health_fund_info/WFD/Terms-and-Conditions.pdf" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a> and Policy documents I have referred to the <a href="health_fund_info/WFD/Glossary-of-Terms.pdf" target="_blank">Glossary of terms</a> or I have asked for and received assistance regarding these matters.</p>
