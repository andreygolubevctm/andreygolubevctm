	<p>Australian Unity's Health Cover is about so much more than just providing excellent Hospital and Extras Cover. They understand that health insurance can be complex and choosing the right Cover can be confusing. That's why Australian Unity's philosophy can be described in two words: Simple. Useful.</p>
	<p>Australian Unity's goal is to ensure members get the most out of their Cover so that it provides continuing value. Whether that be getting use from their Extras Cover, or having a choice of doctor through their Hospital Cover. Australian Unity first started caring for the health of Australians in 1870, so you can rely on their 140 years of experience, to look after your health.</p>
